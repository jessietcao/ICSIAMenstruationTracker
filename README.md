# Menstruation-Tracker

Tracking the menstruation cycle is essential for observing patterns in its length, frequency and effects on an individualâ€™s body. For this reason, this project is developed to fulfill these purposes, improving the personal convenience and the general well-being of the clients by allowing them to record their menstruation cycle and generate predictions for future cycles.
